2017-01-26,Ed Wood,1994,https://boxd.it/drHZR,5,,"Here's a little underrated gem for you.

Ed Wood, directed by Tim Burton, is my favourite movie about movie making. It's funny, sad and inspiring all at the same time and I love it to pieces. And the saddest thing is is that I hardly ever hear people talking about it, which is really quite disappointing.

Johnny Depp plays Edward D. Wood Jr, a man who made some of the worst films of all time such as 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' and 'Glen or Glenda'. Ed Wood also liked to dress up in women's clothing for whatever reason. He befriends Bela Lugosi played brilliantly by Martin Landau and their friendship develops throughout the course of the film.

What is so great about Ed Wood as a person is that he never really concedes defeat and always works hard and absolutely loves what he does, making the movie a great watch for film students. He always accepted the first take even if something went wrong, as he thought it would make the movie seem more 'real'.

There's a scene at the end of the film involving Orson Welles which is actually one of my favourite scenes ever. It's so funny and uplifting and absolutely makes it worth seeing.

Ed Wood is a classic that certainly deserves more recognition than it gets. It's one of my favourites and I strongly urge you to see it as soon as possible.",,
