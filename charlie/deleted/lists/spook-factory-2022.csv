1,Onibaba,1964,https://boxd.it/252a,"Perhaps not the best start to my annual horror marathon (considering this is other things before a horror film), but there's definitely some brilliantly terrifying moments in this, alongside three terrific performances and Shindo's brilliant use of a claustrophobic and dense location. Very sweaty, very creepy and genuinely quite shocking by the end."
2,The Howling,1981,https://boxd.it/1Uce,"Some pretty awesome stuff about this, but for the most part I wasn't nearly as engaged as I wanted to be. Still, it retains a lot of Dante's humour and style that would be perfected in future work, and a pretty great twist too - needless to say I'm a bigger fan of the other werewolf film of '81, however."
3,X,2022,https://boxd.it/sxVa,"It was old-hat when Tarantino did it in 2007, and (rest assured) it still is a decade-and-a-half later. Completely derivative in every sense of the word, the only original inclusion from Ti West being some embarrassing ""avant-garde"" edits, an opening hour spent doing absolutely nothing and a third-act that is nothing but lethargic spaces of time punctuated by passable gore. It's even got overdone religious imagery too! 

Mia Goth is good in it, I guess. Other than that, it's nostalgia-goggled naval gazing from a filmmaker with the sensibilities of a 14 year old boy."
4,The Slumber Party Massacre,1982,https://boxd.it/1rIq,"Smart, subversive and (most importantly) fun as fuck. Worth noting that the killer looks like a mix of Jeff Bezos and Bob from Twin Peaks (he even does the Bob jump thing!), and it is by far the scariest aspect of the film. A worthy addition to Drill Murder Cinema."
5,The Innocents,1961,https://boxd.it/1KeY,"The kind of film I used to watch and rent all the time; in fact I'm not entirely sure this is my first time seeing it. Not a huge amount to say other than that this is a terrifically-shot, eerie tale, anchored by an amazing central performance and Jack Clayton's talent as a visual storyteller. Those British New Wave guys all had a great talent for photographing faces, conveying grand emotion through small movements and mannerisms - for a brief moment in time they were the best in the world at it."
6,Bram Stoker's Dracula,1992,https://boxd.it/223a,"Definitely drags a lot, but it's pretty much impossible to not fall in love with its amazing sets, in-camera effects and unapologetically classic gothic imagery and tone. Tom Waits also rocks."
7,Audition,1999,https://boxd.it/1UHm,"Despite being a Miike-head for several years, I hadn't seen this (take away my card, I guess). Needless to say, it's pretty much textbook brilliance in terms of pacing, performance and foot-related hijinks. Something something Quentin Tarantino toe drinking dot gif. 

(Having to write a lot of reviews when I otherwise wouldn't has led me to be quite glib about great films in the last year, and this is perhaps the most glaring example. I would like to apologise to my Many Readers for my careless disregard of the critical form. I can't change the past, but I can change the future, and I will start writing nonstop Banger reviews after this.)

Cool movie!"
8,The Beyond,1981,https://boxd.it/1FtY,"I'm not the most knowledgable when it comes to Italian horror films, so I can't really comment on where this falls in that tradition, but what I can say is that I have nothing but admiration for how genuine the whole thing is - no irony, no winking, no jokes, just pure terror and love for the craft. Genuinely frightening at times, and with special effects to die for."
9,Brain Damage,1988,https://boxd.it/1qUU,"Wasn't expecting a mix of 60s experimental cinema, The Panic in Needle Park and The Muppet Show, but I'm not complaining (well, not entirely). It didn't really grab me for the most part, but it's pretty funny and creative, and I appreciate Henenlotter for sticking the landing while juggling so many ideas. Worth a look, not quite for me!"
10,Faust,1926,https://boxd.it/1Vxi,"Another movie that doesn't quite qualify as a Spooky Time Classic, but a classic nonetheless. Incredibly entertaining in a way that a lot of silent-era films often aren't, gorgeous and evocative imagery (as is expected) and a genuinely moving rendition of the ""love conquers all""-style climax. I saw this with an industrial/experimental electronic score composed live in a big cinema, and (aside from the romantic interlude in the middle) it made for a perfectly-fitting, dreamy experience."
