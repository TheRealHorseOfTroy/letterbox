10,Shutter Island,2010,https://boxd.it/1U82,"Midway through this, a friend of mine said this was basically Scorsese's ""Nolan Filmâ„¢"", which seems pretty accurate. Quite a brilliant script, but from a filmmaking standpoint it's definitely not one of his best, and doesn't quite do that screenplay justice. Still, it's much better than I was expecting, as someone who considers 2000s Scorsese to be pretty middling."

13,Gangs of New York,2002,https://boxd.it/25FG,"That poster will never not make me nostalgic for wandering around charity shops looking at old VHS tapes, sandwiched between copies of Shrek and Raimi's Spider-Man sequels. Feel like I should be watching it on my old shitty CRT TV from six years ago.

Anyway, there's a great movie in here somewhere, but its troubled production and muddled story really drag it down. Is it a historical epic focused on 19th century democracy, a character study of the immigration experience at that time, a vengeful tragedy, a social comment on the ""duality of evil"" and violence? It seems to try and be all these things at once, and never quite succeeds at any of them. Daniel Day-Lewis' Bill the Butcher is a compelling character, and seeing DDL in a historical drama is always good, but frankly we're given such sparse information about his character that we as an audience, beyond the performance itself, really don't care. Cameron Diaz and Leo DiCaprio give fine performances, but their relationship seems so forced and stilted that, again, we as an audience are given little to care about beyond the surface-level. Frankly, the most entertaining aspect of the film was seeing various British and American actors trying to do Irish and/or American accents (to middling effect), and when you're trying to paint a vivid portrait of a turning point in American history, that's probably not a good sign. Still, it's Scorsese, and there's a lot of beautiful imagery here. Just wish there was a little more for me cling to beyond the abstract.

(side note: this film has some absolutely amazing fonts. another highlight.)"
14,The Wolf of Wall Street,2013,https://boxd.it/3C1m,"Jordan Belfort is not Henry Hill, not even close, and the film falls flat on its face at numerous points because of it. Scorsese is in no way a stranger to these kinds of characters, but the keys to unlocking them are just nowhere near this script. The other shoe never really seems to drop for Belfort, and as a result what you're left with is basically three hours of excess with no real point to it - none of the intense family drama, flagrant style or wit of any of Scorsese's other films, and for a film that strives for such dizzying highs, it really did feel its length. It has its moments, but overall the central question I returned to throughout boiled down to ""what was the point?""."
