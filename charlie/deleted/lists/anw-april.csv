side-note: this is not supposed to reflect a ""comprehensive"" list of the american new wave, so much as films i'm curious about watching/rewatching. there are some films that probably seem like glaring omissions, but yeah. basically i didn't feel like watching cassavetes during this! sorry!

edit: sadly didn't finish this in time, and honestly got a bit sick of the theme. also got busy. sorry! reviews will stay up for the ones i saw and maybe i'll review all the others when i do watch them and post those here"

1,The Godfather,1972,https://boxd.it/2aNK,"Not as good as the Coppola movie where Robin Williams plays a 10 year-old boy, but hey, it's pretty good.

Still marvellous. I hate reviews that start like this, but there's really so little to say at this point that I feel daunted by even trying to review this film. I suppose the one thing that really struck me this time was how Coppola managed to pull together such a masterpiece based almost entirely on the strength of his actors. This film is all about nuances, all about characters, all about this dying family and the flimsy line separating the old and new, obviously set in front of this huge, generation-defining backdrop. I would love to see this in a theater sometime, just be totally consumed by the Corleone family with an audience for three hours. Coppola changed cinema several times (including, arguably, before this, with his script for Patton) but this was where he became an unstoppable creator (until like, now, apparently, where Paramount will greenlight a film about the making of The Godfather but not anything of his). 

Marlon Brando has a funny chin and does that voice you used to hear at dinner parties when you were 8. Watch it!"
2,Network,1976,https://boxd.it/1VqG,"Corporate America eating itself, growing back and being pecked away like Prometheus' liver. Good to see this film is not at all relevant now!"
3,McCabe & Mrs. Miller,1971,https://boxd.it/1ooC,"Technically a total marvel, but I didn't connect with this one very much at all, certainly not compared to most Altman films. Christie and Beatty are great."
4,Harold and Maude,1971,https://boxd.it/2axM,"I'll call it the quintessential cult film of the 1970s. Funny, beautiful, angry, rebellious - it's everything cinema should be, and yet so rarely is. You'd be hard-pressed to find a filmmaker who came out with a more incredible (and consistent) series of films in the 70s than Hal Ashby."
5,Head,1968,https://boxd.it/1HoQ,"Un Chien Andalou for the draft-dodger generation. The graphic footage from Saigon and seizure-inducing psychedelia matched with gleeful slapstick and silliness is kind of the perect analogy of the death of the 60s. Jagger and friends saw that happen in an abrupt, tragic way, but the Monkees saw it coming long before."
6,Nashville,1975,https://boxd.it/25GE,"Man, Shelley Duvall has some great hair in this movie! Also this is probably the best American film of the 1970s. But yeah. Shelley Duvall's hair."
7,The Heartbreak Kid,1972,https://boxd.it/11aM,"Elaine May and Neil Simon dance the line between tragedy and comedy with such confidence, and it's an absolute joy to watch unfold. Criterion should really get on some kind of Elaine May box-set or something, particularly for this film - desperately in need of a new transfer/remaster."
8,Targets,1968,https://boxd.it/1Fbq,"A great film, even if it's a bit of a mess. The sniping sequences in the second half are still genuinely horrifying to watch, and although structurally the film is a little strange, it packs a real punch and vivacity - easily the angriest film Bogdanovich ever made."
9,Bullitt,1968,https://boxd.it/29i2,<i>Drive My Car</i>
10,"Play It Again, Sam",1972,https://boxd.it/1TqO,"Diet Annie Hall in San Francisco with women-beating and Humphrey Bogart. It's got a lot of really sweet moments, but yeah... like a lot of Woody Allen, it finds itself down very familiar roads, but still has a lot of charm. Terrific last scene."
11,"Hi, Mom!",1970,https://boxd.it/Wwy,"Weird, funny, dark, messy, prescient, kind of brilliant. Amazing score as well, which I wasn't expecting. Gonna force this on my family by telling them the guy who directed Mission Impossible made it.

(I still prefer Putney Swope though. Works better as an actual movie, while this doesn't quite get beyond being a series of very weird and darkly comic sequences)"
12,The Godfather: Part II,1974,https://boxd.it/2aNq,"Frankly doesn't really do much more than elaborate on what was brewing beneath the surface of the first, but it does so with such astounding beauty and confidence that it doesn't really need to. De Niro never once falls to imitation, delivering an incredible performance, and Al Pacino probably never played anyone better than Michael Corleone. It's astonishing to see him try to justify his actions to both his personal and broader family, seeing it's pretty hard, and just sort of throwing in the towel. Capitalism dot jpg."
13,Caged Heat,1974,https://boxd.it/13fY,"Like a lot of the Corman-produced exploitation films of the 70s, there's a lot of creativity and imagination on display here that seems a little constrained by both budget and (I assume) contractural expectation. I wouldn't say it's a film I'd be embarrassed to have made or anything (unlike some directorial debuts of this ilk); it's not exactly feminist but certainly not chauvinist, and holds up pretty well all things considered. John Cale doing the soundtrack is pretty funny."
14,All the President's Men,1976,https://boxd.it/29lU,"Absolutely electric. A film that is completely in awe of the journalistic process in ways that have never been matched by thrillers of its ilk since. The script makes no unnecessary diversions; its characters need no more than their work to be compelling (alongside superb central and supporting performances, as well as a terrific script filled with dialogue as suspenseful and dynamic as any thriller I've seen), and it's an absolute joy to watch. I've wanted to see this film for years, and it certainly delivered.

Dustin Hoffman underrated short king btw."
15,Midnight Cowboy,1969,https://boxd.it/25Hi,"Of all the films that have teetered in and out of the ""great"" film canon, I think this is the one that deserves its place among the consistent greats. 

I can remember being somewhat confused by this when I used to see it in my local rental store years ago, assuming it was the most graphic film ever made because of its 18+ rating, trying to figure out how a film with a fairly innocuous name and poster could contain such shocking material. I can't quite say it lives up to that image in my 10-year-old head, but on the other hand it was one of the most riveting and beautiful films I've seen from this period. Hoffman delivers a career best here. Just thinking about his role makes me misty-eyed - he takes what could've easily been a caricature (and has subsequently become one) and makes it totally emotional and believable, particularly when put alongside Voight's character, a polar opposite but with matching extremities. It's as much a portrait of New York as it is a changing America - an America that could not be kept away from the screen any longer, and one of those few truly necessary films for its time and place. People don't talk about this film very much anymore it seems, but they absolutely should be."
16,M*A*S*H,1970,https://boxd.it/29U6,"Problematic Fave now I guess.

I do not blame anyone for absolutely hating this film. It's mean, pretty dated, often gross, and pretty often not very funny (by today's standards anyway). But there's something magical about the way this film totally captured the cultural zeitgeist, and the wants of a deeply frustrated country. It also defined the work of one of my favourite filmmakers, and after seeing a lot of his films, I just get so excited seeing his work in this state.

It's also worth noting, I think, that Altman is not showing the actions of Sutherland and Gould with the sense of schoolboy glee that a lot of people attribute to the film. If anything, I think Altman finds a lot of their behaviour as crass and gross as a lot of modern audiences do when viewing the film. However, the media response during the early stages of Vietnam warranted this warts-and-all look at those reluctant victims of war (both Vietnam and Korea), and it's interesting to note the significance that media such as this (and particularly television) had on the public, and their perception of US involvement. That's not to say I think Altman was purely thinking about things from the lens of a public do-gooder necessarily - just that there's more nuance here than I think a lot of people see when viewing it today. But again, if you hate this movie that's entirely valid. As an obsessive for this period of history, I find it fascinating more than fully enjoyable, and there's a lot I still find kind of repugnant about it, but I think at the end of the day it told the truth when very few films were. 

RIP Sally Kellerman, you ruled."
17,Brewster McCloud,1970,https://boxd.it/1tIi,"Still fucking weird, but as a huge fan of vintage Altman (and Bud Cort) ((and Shelley Duvall)) I can't help but love it."
18,Putney Swope,1969,https://boxd.it/1gV4,"One of the funniest and most beautifully insane movies of the era. Downey absolutely dominated a very small but deeply influential part of film history, carving out a legacy through tiny New York theaters and a totally fearless attitude. This film is also beautifully shot too - something people are often quick to forget when describing the film, though understandably so, considering how much other shit there is here - the beautiful Film Foundation restoration (funded by George Lucas of all people) really makes his dynamic camera movements and broader composition pop.

Honestly feel this film should be studied and revitalised, especially in the wake of his passing. Up Madison Ave.(.)"
19,Greetings,1968,https://boxd.it/2vo2,"Pales in comparison to Hi, Mom! in basically every way. It's pretty fun in places (the ""Delivery Boy and Bored Housewife"" sequence, which actually predates the famous Clockwork Orange quick-cut sex sequence by a few years, and the numerous draft-dodging exercises by De Niro and the boys are great) but beyond those moments it's a bit of a drag. Seeing early De Niro and De Palma is always fun, but if I wanted that, I can think of at least two better examples."
20,Two-Lane Blacktop,1971,https://boxd.it/1sfE,"One of those movies that I probably wouldn't review if I didn't have to. It's cool, looks beautiful, has Harry Dean Stanton in it and remains a totally definitive ""American New Wave"" film. The real thing I want to bring up is how ""Monte Hellman"" is literally the coolest name any filmmaker has ever had. Read it back and think about it, and you'll see I'm right. 

Anyway, I feel like you'll probably know going into this if you'll enjoy it or not. I did!"
21,Easy Rider,1969,https://boxd.it/29Ys,"It's definitely true, inevitable and kind of moot to say that Easy Rider is dated, but there's enough sad beauty and striking imagery throughout to keep the film relevant and exciting, at least as a purely visual piece. Probably prefer ""Head"" as the ultimate psychedelic Jack Nicholson romp."
