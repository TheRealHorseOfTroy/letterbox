1,The 36th Chamber of Shaolin,1978,https://boxd.it/1SXC,"The euphoria of physicality and movement is right at the heart of this film. Though much of it has been parodied to death, Liu Chia-Liang never takes the obvious route with his filmmaking style and structure - like the absolute best wuxia/kung fu films, this is all about the trials and tribulations of achieving physical idealism, as well as the strong social conscience that comes with it (great power, etc..) as opposed to Cool Kicks and dramatic zooms. The Kurosawan finale is a little bit rushed - the film could perhaps do with a few more scenes between San Ta and his band of heroes -  but that's about the only flaw I can muster up.

Also, I got a strong pang of nostalgia from the early training sequences because I'm pretty sure the old death-run maps in Team Fortress 2 were inspired by them. I am certain no other reviewer of this film has brought this up, so now you can go away with more world-weary knowledge than you previously had at your disposal."
2,The Boxer's Omen,1983,https://boxd.it/Gx6,"The other side of the Shaw Brothers coin. Going from 36th Chamber of Shaolin to this was both a pretty shocking change and also kind of not; there's certainly a love of exploitation film (and Buddhism, I guess?) running through both. It's slightly too long, but nonetheless an insanely good time, full of genuinely shocking imagery, perfectly hammy performances and actually kind of great locations - I wanna visit the Thailand Buddhist Retreat & Boxing Conference Centre sometime. Definitely worth pairing up with The Seventh Curse or Riki-Oh."
3,The Five Venoms,1978,https://boxd.it/1Q5o,"<i>Five Angry Men.</i>

The first of many Chang Cheh films this month, and unfortunateIy I can't quite say I loved it. Aside from his very strong and dynamic camerawork, which succeeds in making the film's fairly rudimentary (and frequent) dialogue-heavy sequences exciting and broadly experimental, there's really not a lot here to latch onto - the procedural elements didn't pull me in, and the character motivations were ultimately a little muddled, making it hard to remain invested. Still, I'm excited to see his other work, as there's certainly something very exciting lurking beneath the film."
4,The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter,1984,https://boxd.it/1h2a,"Liu Chia-Liang takes a fairly standard formula and finds completely new ways to interpret it. The fight sequences are truly evocative and almost dance-like (moreso than almost anything else he's made), and Chia-Liang's clear interest in the inherently cinematic nature of martial arts make the whole thing exhilarating to watch - in some ways it feels like an end-point for this era of SB productions."
5,Five Fingers of Death,1972,https://boxd.it/1Bfy,"Gets a bit muddled in the second act, but Jeong Chang-Hwa's gritty action sequences make a nice change from the grandiosity of the other SB films I've seen. Extraordinary use of colour in this one too, particularly during the climactic fight - we're very lucky to have such pristine copies of these films at our disposal."
6,Five Element Ninjas,1982,https://boxd.it/ZvS,"No idea how The Five Venoms is more popular than this; it's easily the most entertaining of the Shaw Brothers films I've seen. It feels like most of the parodies of kung-fu films in general could stem from this - genuinely inventive camera movements and techniques are peppered throughout (even fisheye at one point!), blood is sprayed so often it becomes almost a textural necessity in each sequence, the colours (aside from red) are so unbelievably vivid that it easily trumps so many derivative action films of the time, Chinese or otherwise. It's incredible.

Also the set in the last fight looks like that Star Trek episode where they meet the guy who thinks he's Zeus."
