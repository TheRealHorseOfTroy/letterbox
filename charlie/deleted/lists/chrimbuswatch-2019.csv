1,Bottle Rocket,1996,https://boxd.it/1PDa,"Still think the second act teeters a bit, but the wonderful characters and filmmaking definitely shine through. Not one of my favourites from Anderson, but a delightfully funny movie regardless."
2,A Nightmare on Elm Street,1984,https://boxd.it/2aw0,"Fun romp. Not my favourite movie ever, but it still holds up fairly well."
3,Ran,1985,https://boxd.it/1Tlu,Probably the best-looking film I've ever seen. Magnificent.
