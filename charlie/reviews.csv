2020-02-04,Dead or Alive,1999,https://boxd.it/YupV7,4,,"as everyone is quick to point out, the opening to this movie is fucking nuts, moving at beyond a breakneck pace and littered with sex and violence. it's pretty fucking incredible to say the least, and i don't blame people for pointing it out in their reviews.

beyond that great opening, however, lies a tremendously shot and well-acted crime film that moves slowly but with great fluidity. miike's style works incredibly well during the more straightforward scenes, and certainly elevates a lot of them (although on its own merit i think the script works well).

2021-07-13,Being There,1979,https://boxd.it/1ZulnR,4,,"one of the most unique pieces of social satire i've seen. it seems to be the kind of film that can be perfectly valuable as a humoured critique of the simplicity of the media and those in power, but i think Ashby's message is ultimately much sadder than that - Chance is used by almost everyone he meets to satisfy a personal need, taking his simple ""philosophies"" and gleaning from them whatever they want. in some cases, this manifests itself in political slogans and soundbites, yes, but for the most part he is used by people who are lonely, struggling or in some sort of personal pain as an empty, brazenly sincere canvas for them to paint how they see fit. Sellers, obviously, conveys this beautifully, with just the right restraint and candidness, and alongside Hal Ashby's similarly tempered direction creates a bittersweet and moving comedy of manners of sorts - alongside an occasionally discomforting portrayal of the closemindedness and selfishness that follows the media and political elite, as well as the rest of us.",,2021-07-13

i'm probably overreacting slightly, but there's a good chance <i>Harold and Maude<i> may be my new favourite film. genuinely can't remember the last time i smiled so much during a movie - it's absolutely filled with empathy and warmth, and a fucking shining example of what American New Wave cinema was able to accomplish during the early-to-mid 70s. it's an obvious influence but it gave me the same feeling as watching Wes Anderson's movies when i was younger and just being floored by the artistry on display - i've only seen this and <i>Being There<i>, but i have no doubt of Ashby's genius as a filmmaker.

amazed it took me this long to get around to this. i have tried to get into cronenberg's films several times over and not really gotten much out of them, but there's certainly a lot to love here, most of which has been talked about extensively (creature effects, allegories, etc). my main issue with the film is that it felt a little uneven at times, particularly during the second act - personally, i would've preferred some more time between brundle and veronica than seeing jeff goldblum break some random dude's wrist and doing flips. still, certainly worth seeing - an at-times disgusting, (mostly) engaging bit of classic body-horror.

2021-07-17,M*A*S*H,1970,https://boxd.it/1ZVeBr,3,,"a great-looking, deeply flawed black comedy that has saving graces but is ultimately let down by its weakest moments. 

i think for me, the ultimate flaw is that the characters that are most negatively treated are not really shown to be entirely deserving of what happens to them. hot lips is described as a controlling, nurse ratchet-like character, but we never actually see that during the film - in fact, the only time i recalled it being alluded to was donald sutherland mentioning it as a segue into the football game finale - and robert duvall's nervous breakdown is supposed to be excusable because he has a stern demeanour and bible-bashes, like, once. i feel like this movie could've been great and still held up today had there been a clearer message or stance against militarism and authority than there was, but as it stands it boils down to 2 hours of fairly structureless gags and pranks that occasionally allude to a more interesting critique, but never actually seem to go there.

having said that, i did absolutely love the look of the film (so many beautiful zooms, tracking shots and wide-angle lenses, my GOD), and there was enough to it that i was never fully disengaged while watching. i just wish it had more to say, and said it without resorting to cheap, boys-club humour.",,2021-07-17
2021-08-09,Chungking Express,1994,https://boxd.it/23vYo3,5,,"I have been meaning to properly watch this for years now, after many shitty copies and mistranslated versions have floated my way, and I can't wait to see it again. A world I want to live in forever, and the first film I've seen in a while that gave me that special feeling of shock when it was over, partly from awe and partly from surprise that it had gone by so fast. Wong Kar Wai is an absolute genius, and I feel like I could watch this film right now and be just as enthralled.

I'll write something more meaningful for this then, but wow. Movies like this make me realise why I live my life as I do, constantly searching for that art that moves me profoundly, takes me out of myself, and shows me a world I've never seen before. Even in his films that I don't personally connect with, Wong Kar Wai manages to achieve one of these things every single time, and flawlessly achieves everything I could want here, with legendary style and grace to boot.

2021-08-10,In the Mood for Love,2000,https://boxd.it/23EQAD,4.5,Yes,"I was evidently a dumb, naive, Big Idiot when I first watched this.

One thing I noticed while watching it this time around was the way in which the story could feasibly work in almost any artistic medium, but Wong Kar Wai is able to tell it in a way that makes it so unmistakably and unforgettably cinematic, taking already great material to a new, unique place. Beautifully and tragically simple on the surface, but with more emotional complexity than pretty much any other romance I've ever seen on film.

(My initial review was gonna be something like ""lots of wanton soup, but not a lot of wanton romance!"" but I thought better of it. Sorry Wong.)",,2021-08-10

2021-08-22,Reservoir Dogs,1992,https://boxd.it/25kkEr,4,Yes,"Quentin Tarantino was the first director I really got into when I started using Letterboxd, and since then my stance on him has ebbed and flowed pretty frequently - for a long time after the fact, my default stance on him as a filmmaker has been that he relies far too heavily on self-indulgent references and characters that talk exactly like him, something that seems refreshing and original the first time and tiresome as you watch more and more of his films. I took particular dislike to this one in the years since, but upon revisiting it, I see it as a fairly good example of what he does best - conflicted characters in confined spaces, a non-linear narrative that's satisfying without being too noticeable and a script that's smart and quick-witted without being overbearing.

I'm glad this film finally clicked with me, but it's left me a little unsure about how I'll respond to his later stuff again.",,2021-08-22
2021-08-23,Pulp Fiction,1994,https://boxd.it/25n2GZ,4,Yes,"For me, this movie starts out kind of uneven, with every character sounding too much like Quentin Tarantino - so much so that I often felt like Michael Stone in Anomalisa, drowning in a sea of people saying ""alright"" too often - and sequences that just didn't really pack much of an emotional punch to me, to an absolute masterclass in acting, direction, writing, everything. The second half of this film (from the Bruce Willis story to the perfect finale) is genuinely brilliant, but I feel the first half does kinda let it down, though not enough to be dissuaded from the consensus here (and everywhere else on the planet, apparently).

My fondest memory associated with this film was walking around my local video shop when I was about 10 and first getting into cinema and seeing Uma Thurman as some sort of cult movie god, guarding a film that was seemingly impossible for me to ever witness. Didn't quite live up to that when I first saw it (although I was only like, 13), but still.

I forgot how well-written this was, paced out with brilliant sequences of suspense that really elevate a lot of the film's more violent sequences. There are numerous characters who are only in the film for indivudal scenes, but are as unforgettable as the major roles. 

Probably Tarantino's best film since Kill Bill.",,2021-08-24
2021-08-26,Blue Velvet,1986,https://boxd.it/25OcDb,5,,"I love so much about this movie, but one thing that sticks out is how Lynch shot everything with that beautiful, wide-angle, fuzzy lens that obscures the rims of the frames, forcing you to focus on the middle of the frame. It creates an idyllic image in the suburban locations, but amplifies the horror of the film's most extreme moments. Perhaps that's a good analogy for the whole thing.

Also, the recent remasters of this look absolutely stunning. Wonder what 1979 George Miller would make of the idea that people would still be watching this film 40 years on.

Its female characters, though perhaps deliberate, are either characterless or conspire against the film's main character (though I understand that this may have been intended, it makes for a rather one-sided script) and it is often hard to see the angle Fassbinder was trying to explore, with an awkward mix of wry comedy and drama that sometimes works, and sometimes doesn't. It's still an interesting film, however, with some good performances, and perhaps his first to really wrestle with issues that plagued him personally.

What a gorgeous movie. Great performances and an unrelentingly dreamy vibe - it's a genre film through-and-through, yet feels as though it exists in several different worlds. Tony Scott is seemingly able to pull the film wherever he pleases, matching up frenetically-edited gothic horror with a vivid sense of sensuality and use of the frame, a-la Blue Velvet, or the 70s-era Hitchcock that influenced both. It's not a perfect film but I have nothing but admiration for its dedication to such a unique aesthetic, and it is able to create a more vivid sense of fear than any of the gross-out body horror/slasher films from the time. Maybe a good double-feature with Roeg's Don't Look Now?

Hadn't seen this one in years, and was pleased to find it really holds up. While I do think it drags a little bit in the last third, there's still so much to love - Alex Cox's clear passion for filmmaking was evident right from the beginning, shooting Los Angeles so vividly and beautifully, and seeing Harry Dean Stanton in a top-billing role is always good. There's not much to be said about this film that hasn't been said already, but it's obviously a shame that Alex Cox's career as a filmmaker didn't continue past Walker (a film I will someday write at length about), and I do kind of wish he had the opportunity to make a major studio genre film like this again.

It's a love-letter to filmmaking, the bittersweet idiocy and weird beauty of holding onto lost love, and finding fulfillment in whatever way you can.

Rewatching this and the original Evil Dead film more or less annually is always fun, but I'm left with the same issues every time. Obviously the movie's fun as hell, and Bruce Campbell finally cements the image of both himself and the Ash character here (paving the way for the wonderful Ash vs Evil Dead), but I find the second half of Army of Darkness very hard to sit through - the final battle sequence just doesn't quite capture the scope of the films it's poking fun at, making a lot of it fall a little flat. It's great to see so many in-camera/practical effects on display, and probably has the most creative camerawork of the entire trilogy, but doesn't really stick the landing, at least for me.

It's a shame the campiness of this movie wasn't played up so much more in its marketing; I feel like it would've been re-appraised so much quicker if that were the case. Anyway, it's pretty great; existing in that sweet-spot of being dated, but in a charming, remember-when-whiny-emo-pop-was-popular-and-people-texted-in-abbreviations kinda way. It's really well-directed too - considering all the awful direct-to-dumpster horror movies that were floating around in '09 it's refreshing to see a filmmaker actually play with the frame and craft a unique atmosphere -and the script is sharp, funny and though it occasionally falters in blurring the lines between horror and comedy it mostly sticks the landing.

2021-10-14,Seven Samurai,1954,https://boxd.it/2cIG1H,5,,"People often do this film a disservice when discussing it. While it's certainly valid to talk about its influence, tangentially or otherwise, on pretty much every major film since the 60s and 70s, and its flawless performances and direction, there's so much here beyond that. While it's not my favourite Kurosawa, I do think it may be my favourite script of his - the English-language remakes and ""reimaginings"" of Seven Samurai often take its base story and little else, crafting cheap caricatures with obvious character traits and motivations, making the inevitable final confrontation pretty sterile and boring, totally misunderstanding what makes the film so successful. These characters are loveable, yes, but also perfectly realised; Kurosawa and his co-writers have the courage to fully develop them and their world, and make the film's second half so incredibly powerful and beautiful as a result. Like so many Japanese films of the immediate post-war period, the film is a subtle critique of Japanese culture and ancient history, shown most obviously by the clear divide between the farmers and samurai that ultimately never finds itself resolved, yet does so in a way that never overshadows the universality of its story. It's a perfectly-handled narrative, beautifully directed and performed. It is very good, a controversial take that will surely get me ""Blocked & Removed"".

This should've been a slapstick comedy involving Jason and Corey Feldman's Home Alone-esque props and traps. Missed opportunity.

Adding  characters to the mix who are separated from the campers is a very good choice, and gives the audience someone to actually root for beyond the usual preppy high-schoolers we get in most of the F13 films. Tom Savini is great as usual, but it does still suffer from the same flaws as the others in the series - lots of annoying characters just sort of wondering about, a rather confused tone at times, and just generally uninteresting direction drag it down, but this is probably my favourite of the first four films.

Absolutely beautiful to look at. Great script and some career-defining performances from Noonan and Cox, and though it's not Tangerine Dream, still has a great synth-led score. Mann has such great attention to detail in how he frames his shots here - Lecktor's plain-white cell, the blue-neon hues leaking through the windows of the Graham household, the ominous Blake painting in the middle of the killer's house - all give off such a tremendous atmosphere, and elevate the film a great deal.

The premise is obviously fantastic, but another great thing it does is allow the film to be pretty low-key, saving the biggest moments for very specific points, making those payoffs absolutely fantastic. I suppose the fact that it's as restrained as it is has led a lot of people to finding it dull, which I suppose is fair, but I see it as an impressively mature move on the part of Cronenberg (at least this early in his career), and it elevates the film massively.

Maybe some light spoilers, so tread lightly if you don't want that.

I think I sometimes feel I have a more complicated relationship to the films of Ingmar Bergman than I really do. I have issues with some of his work (as of now I still canât get into <i>Persona</i>, though I need to revisit it) but overall I find his approach to filmmaking startling. <i>The Seventh Seal</i> was one of the first art-films I ever saw, and I was utterly transfixed by its complex narrative, deep emotional core and the overwhelmingly personal throughline that connected it all. Bergman has always had an eye for matching opposites, budding complex personalities against one-another, yet ultimately his stories seemed to always come down to a deep personal struggle, more often than not concerning his own spirituality and relationship with faith. Of course, many of his films stray from this central theme, but it is absolutely necessary to mention when discussing <i>Fanny and Alexander</i>, the film that Bergman believed to be the âsum-total of his work as a filmmakerâ, and his final work (though that proved untrue), and these feelings are abundant from the earliest moments of the film. It is an astonishingly complex piece of work, undoubtedly one of the most startlingly truthful and depthful forays into the life of a large and conflicted family Iâve ever seen, and remains a milestone in both Bergmanâs career and 20th-century cinema in general. Though it structurally resembles classic literature, in the hands of Bergman you could not imagine its story being told in any other way.

The filmâs opening slowly unravels itself, taking its time in introducing us to the Ekdahl family. Though much of the film is seen through the eyes of Alexander, much of this first segment is instead more concerned with showing us the inner lives of his (extended) family, in a series of confrontations that I found utterly startling, and very much unlike many other Bergman films. He lays everything on the table here, depicting characters steeped in melodrama and fraught with tension, contrasted with the comparatively psychological torment of his earlier work, with isolated characters trying to connect to one-another. Bergman instead shows us both sides of this coin; we see both the familyâs inner turmoils and their perceptions of each other, as they meet together several times throughout. Itâs not necessarily subtle, but itâs not trying to nor needs to be - though <i>Fanny and Alexander</i> is primarily a story of childhood, Bergman understands that in order to paint that picture one needs an accurate representation of the family that surrounds its titular characters, and uses his opening to flesh this idea out as much as possible. Itâs a great sequence.

The rest of the film follows Fanny and Alexanderâs life following the death of their father, and shows Bergmanâs sentiments regarding the film to be more than just that - though Iâm no expert, it doesnât really take one to appreciate that so much of what he achieves here truly encapsulates his essence as a filmmaker. Philosophical deliberations, theological delusions, genuinely frightening, surrealist imagery and a sense of self-criticism and reflection are all dealt with and deliberated throughout the film - Bergman examines the effect of art and performance through the Ekdahl playhouse, and though not quite overt (itâs hardly Brechtian in any way), the sense of absurdity and tragedy that mars much of Alexanderâs story can be seen as synonymous with his fatherâs profession (I mean, he dies during a production of <i>Hamlet</i>), and does in a way act as an indicator for the audience to pull back and reflect upon what theyâre seeing. This mild sense of detachment is also mirrored in Bergmanâs striking visual style - though not necessarily unrealistic, Bergmanâs use of colour is nonetheless striking, occasionally breaking into unrealistic, stage-like lighting that gives the film an extraordinary sense of style unlike any other film of his, including the perhaps equally-creative work of films like <i>Cries and Whispers</i>. Itâs perfectly-balanced - Bergman gives himself the freedom to experiment with cross-fades, zooms and angles, while maintaining a fixed, subdued style that makes these sequences even more exciting, elevating the film to a kind of magical-realism that perhaps mirrors the supernatural elements introduced in the ensuing segments. As with most of his films, every player here is perfect, most notably Bertil Guve and Pernilla Allwin, who inhabit their roles perfectly, giving some of the best child performances Iâve ever seen, but credit must also be given to Jan MalmsjÃ¶ as Edvard, acting as the perfect ominous presence, never over-or-underselling his performance - something that would be rather easy to do, yet he never falters. You get the impression that he sincerely feels a kind of twisted love for the Ekdahl family, and is never reduced to a stereotypical âevil otherâ, although naturally he is, you know, a pretty bad dude. Itâs a move that almost certainly reflects Bergmanâs complicated relationship with his faith, recognising the authoritarian tendencies of the Church, but at the same time the kind of strange affection that comes from that. Itâs fascinating to see him deal with this level of emotional complexity in a story thatâs already as layered as this film certainly is, and it pays off tremendously well.

I love this film. I love how it deals with the absurdity of family life, the role of an artist, the unintended consequences of a tumultuous upbringing - Bergman juggles these themes, themes that would make a single film great, altogether here, and pulls it off, with spirits and ghosts and what-not to boot. Iâm honestly a little scared to watch the theatrical version now because I canât really think of anything Iâd cut to fit just over half the run-time of the miniseries version. I suppose that speaks to the enormity and perfection of <i>Fanny and Alexander</i>. Honestly, if Bergman had to be remembered for one film, I wouldnât be remiss if it was this.

I enjoy this film more and more every time I see it. Cosmic horror has never really been my thing (I find Lovecraft incredibly boring, sorry NERDS...) but when it's done well it can be startlingly effective, as is the case here.

Anyway, there's a great movie in here somewhere, but its troubled production and muddled story really drag it down. Is it a historical epic focused on 19th century democracy, a character study of the immigration experience at that time, a vengeful tragedy, a social comment on the ""duality of evil"" and violence? It seems to try and be all these things at once, and never quite succeeds at any of them. Daniel Day-Lewis' Bill the Butcher is a compelling character, and seeing DDL in a historical drama is always good, but frankly we're given such sparse information about his character that we as an audience, beyond the performance itself, really don't care. Cameron Diaz and Leo DiCaprio give fine performances, but their relationship seems so forced and stilted that, again, we as an audience are given little to care about beyond the surface-level.

Even now, on my fourth watch, I'm still noticing little things that support all the weird ideas that have been tossed around since its release (is Adam Sandler Superman a-la Unbreakable? Is Emily Watson secretly stalking him throughout the first third of the movie? Is this story being observed by aliens obsessed with lens flares?, etc). It's a testament to Paul Thomas Anderson's craft as a filmmaker that he's able to draw so much out of a narrative that, in the hands of anyone else, could easily fall apart, and makes this one of the strangest and most enlivening movies I've ever seen.

Following up two of the most celebrated epics of the 90s, it presumably seemed bizarre that PTA would helm a 90-minute romance film with Adam Sandler as his lead, but when you think about the content of those films, it kind of makes sense. Though obviously not crafting nearly as emotionally complex a character as Sandler's Barry Egan, Mark Wahlberg kind of followed a similar path in terms of the likely public response - a commercially successful, critically maligned artist taking a role in a film decidedly out of their comfort zone - and PTA is idiosyncratic enough as a person that the casting decisions made for this film seem slightly less strange. It has to be said that Sandler is pretty much perfect in this, taking the kind of character that would be getting laughs in one of his comedy vehicles and stripping him down to reveal the pathetic, sad and lonely core that rests at the heart of so many of them. It's a testament to his skill as an actor that this film would be fundamentally broken without him. I've used Punch-Drunk Love as a point of reference when discussing Adam Sandler with people who hate him in the past (who hasn't, I guess), and whenever I do I realise that part of the film's seductive quality is the fact that it exists as an oxymoron, leaving the viewer unsure of what they're going to be getting before the film even starts. It's not intentional necessarily, but it's a fascinating aspect of the film that I've never really seen elsewhere.

The rest of the cast is perfect too, of course. The fact that Emily Watson and Philip Seymour Hoffman, two of the most celebrated actors of the time, act alongside someone like Sandler yet never overshadow or throw him off is pretty astounding. I think that perhaps it helps that the film is itself so alien and out-there; Robert Elswit's cinematography draws from a myriad of sources - Kubrick, the French New Wave, 50s classic romances and musicals and PTA's own body of work - instilling in the viewer a feeling that I've never had with any other film. Again, it's an oxymoron; it feels so insular and intimate, yet completely distant at the same time. Anderson has always shot with beautiful Panavision lenses, and I don't think that's ever paid off better than here. The film's similarly odd lighting gives off a similar feel. Barry's workplace is constantly drenched in lens flares and blue hues, giving the sequences there (on top of all the carnage - I mean, the scene where he and Emily Watson's character meet for the first time is basically the most anxiety-inducing sequence in all of film) a distinctly alien and distant quality.

And yet, in spite of these techniques that should take me out of the film and appreciate it for its technical mastery, I am always left enchanted by its story and in tears at the same points I've seen so many times before. I wouldn't call it lightning-in-a-bottle necessarily, but everything seemed to fall into place here, and at the same time I'd be remiss not to mention Jon Brion's score, an eclectic array of dreamy musical numbers, literal musical numbers (ie ""He Needs Me"", from Altman's Popeye) and at the same time a series of percussive music pieces made from tapes of PTA himself drumming on his knees, it really leans into the magical, surreal, sad and totally unique nature of the film, and again, remains inseparable from the movie itself.

I totally get why a lot of people are put off by this. It's melodramatic to the point where ""melodrama"" doesn't seem to cut it as a descriptor, but then again, so's life, and I feel that even at its most absurd, this is a more real and personal love story than most. They may be somewhat tired comparisons, but PTA's first four films really do stand up there with the likes of the first features of pioneers like Robert Altman or Martin Scorsese as pillars of American filmmaking.

I went into Titane expecting pure insanity and madness, and came out in near-tears, pretty much floored by its originality, sadness and beauty. One of the most intelligent and nuanced takes on loss and family I've ever seen, and like all great ""horror"" films, it makes you completely surrender yourself to its premise. Incredible performances, phenomenal direction (particularly for a second feature), and easily one of the best films of the year. ",,2021-11-22

Anya Taylor-Joy and Terrence Stamp have the most fun with what little they're given, and Thomasin McKenzie is also quite good, but other than those performances (and the occasional Homage Shot or whatever) this was a complete mess. How did the guy who made some of the most precise and meticulously-planned British comedies of the century come to this? The script regularly falls back on cheap contrived plot elements (there's even the textbook ""mean student"" characters, despite there being literally no reason for them existing other than to get the wheels of the plot in motion), and a ""twist"" so lazily-written that putting the pieces together afterwards just made me roll my eyes instead of psych myself up about the Joys of Filmmaking, like Nick Frost's ""bloody Mary"" speech in Shaun. I saw a lot of middling reviews for this, but remained on board with the premise and cast; after about half an hour I realised that yeah, this ain't it.

Niamh Algar is absolutely astounding, one of the finest British actresses I've seen in a long time, and Prano Bailey-Bond demonstrates a stunning visual flair that manages to be both referential and original, unlike a certain other film from this year that didn't do it quite so well.

Every time I wanted to call this possibly the greatest ""rockumentary"" ever made, this quote kept cropping up - can I really give this that title considering that it's been made with such a niche crowd in mind? Frankly, I'm amazed it exists in its current iteration; few people know about the break-up of The Beatles as it really happened, and even fewer know about the troubled production of Michael Lindsay-Hogg's original film, the 1970 Let it Be documentary buried by its stars and panned by those who saw it. However, when I was watching the final hour of this, I realised that this really can't be graded on criteria made for other documentaries, even other documentaries about the band. What Peter Jackson has done here is extraordinary - from hundreds of hours of audio and video footage, he's managed to give perhaps the most studied and popular group of the last 60 years a definitive send-off; the proper final chapter that they never really got. Sure, it suffers from a bit of bloat (what Jackson project since Braindead or Heavenly Creatures hasn't?) and it's occasionally a bit aimless, but that's a worthy - if not necessary - price to pay for what we got from this.

Jackie Chan gets drunk and destroys colonialism.

for me, this film is so great because Jackie perfectly finds the balance between the humour and kind of divine weight of martial arts, and walks that line beautifully. he knows that to get an audience to root for him he has to craft a character that's human and fallible but still, you know, deliver the goods when the time comes - as a result, there's not only tension during those fight scenes, but a level of likability that stems from those earlier set-ups that allows Chan freedom to deliver these amazing, complex moves without ever losing the charming affability of the character he's playing. you feel a kinship with Chan that you just don't get from the likes of Bruce Lee/Jet Li/Donnie Yen/whoever else, and it draws you in instantly. i still prefer Police Story, but this has a special place in my heart as one of the earliest introductions to HK cinema i had, back when i still rented DVDs and watched videos on the Cinemassacre website - the footwork in the final fight scene still blows my mind.",,2022-01-20

Not as good as the Coppola movie where Robin Williams plays a 10 year-old boy, but hey, it's pretty good.

Still marvellous. I hate reviews that start like this, but there's really so little to say at this point that I feel daunted by even trying to review this film. I suppose the one thing that really struck me this time was how Coppola managed to pull together such a masterpiece based almost entirely on the strength of his actors. This film is all about nuances, all about characters, all about this dying family and the flimsy line separating the old and new, obviously set in front of this huge, generation-defining backdrop. I would love to see this in a theater sometime, just be totally consumed by the Corleone family with an audience for three hours. Coppola changed cinema several times (including, arguably, before this, with his script for Patton) but this was where he became an unstoppable creator (until like, now, apparently, where Paramount will greenlight a film about the making of The Godfather but not anything of his).

Of all the films that have teetered in and out of the ""great"" film canon, I think this is the one that deserves its place among the consistent greats. 

I can remember being somewhat confused by this when I used to see it in my local rental store years ago, assuming it was the most graphic film ever made because of its 18+ rating, trying to figure out how a film with a fairly innocuous name and poster could contain such shocking material. I can't quite say it lives up to that image in my 10-year-old head, but on the other hand it was one of the most riveting and beautiful films I've seen from this period. Hoffman delivers a career best here. Just thinking about his role makes me misty-eyed - he takes what could've easily been a caricature (and has subsequently become one) and makes it totally emotional and believable, particularly when put alongside Voight's character, a polar opposite but with matching extremities. It's as much a portrait of New York as it is a changing America - an America that could not be kept away from the screen any longer, and one of those few truly necessary films for its time and place. People don't talk about this film very much anymore it seems, but they absolutely should be.

Problematic Fave now I guess.

I do not blame anyone for absolutely hating this film. It's mean, pretty dated, often gross, and pretty often not very funny (by today's standards anyway). But there's something magical about the way this film totally captured the cultural zeitgeist, and the wants of a deeply frustrated country. It also defined the work of one of my favourite filmmakers, and after seeing a lot of his films, I just get so excited seeing his work in this state.

It's also worth noting, I think, that Altman is not showing the actions of Sutherland and Gould with the sense of schoolboy glee that a lot of people attribute to the film. If anything, I think Altman finds a lot of their behaviour as crass and gross as a lot of modern audiences do when viewing the film. However, the media response during the early stages of Vietnam warranted this warts-and-all look at those reluctant victims of war (both Vietnam and Korea), and it's interesting to note the significance that media such as this (and particularly television) had on the public, and their perception of US involvement. That's not to say I think Altman was purely thinking about things from the lens of a public do-gooder necessarily - just that there's more nuance here than I think a lot of people see when viewing it today. But again, if you hate this movie that's entirely valid. As an obsessive for this period of history, I find it fascinating more than fully enjoyable, and there's a lot I still find kind of repugnant about it, but I think at the end of the day it told the truth when very few films were.

One of the funniest and most beautifully insane movies of the era. Downey absolutely dominated a very small but deeply influential part of film history, carving out a legacy through tiny New York theaters and a totally fearless attitude.

My main takeaway during the second half of the film basically amounted to ""the Daniels boys have good hearts"". The humour and action didn't really land for me, and when Part 2 hit I found myself getting a little exhausted, but then when the real meaning of the film kicked in I was pretty profoundly moved. The homages were much less specific than A24's marketing would have you believe, but that ends up freeing the film to the truly infinite possibilities of what's being described (as opposed to just Michelle Yeoh In Chungking Express or something, although that would probably bump it up a star). 

Probably some of Michelle Yeoh's best work here. She draws from everything she's ever done and is so easily emotionally engaging and fun to watch (as she's always been). Ke Huy Quan is just so wonderful throughout the entire thing - absolutely lights up the screen, and shows range far beyond what's necessary for the material, honestly.

I suppose I can see why they went the way they did with this - that is, getting Baz Luhrmann's Craig Pearce to write it, making the standard story into a weird kind of melodramatic rock opera - but it just doesn't work. It's not so much that the performances are bad, rather that they are simply wholly inaccurate, making people like McLaren and (especially) John Lydon into even bigger caricatures than the Pistols' public image (har!) already did. The whole thing just reeks of phoniness, and when dealing with a genuinely interesting point in history I feel like so much more could've been done with this format in mind. Imagine if Boyle had done this in his heyday? 

On the subject, Danny Boyle's direction has really gone downhill in the last decade, too. If there was ever a project to mark a return to film and rejection of the awful digital photography he's been working with, it would be this one, especially considering the aspect ratio and general vibe of the whole thing, yet instead he sinks in deeper, giving everything this horrible smeary look that stops the show from really ever looking half as good as it should, considering what he's obviously capable of.

Who is this for? It's not for fans of the band, fans of that period of British music (or that period of history for that matter) or the modern day punks you see wandering about in their $500+ uniforms - it's just there. Hm.

The Kurosawan finale is a little bit rushed - the film could perhaps do with a few more scenes between San Ta and his band of heroes -  but that's about the only flaw I can muster up.

Also, I got a strong pang of nostalgia from the early training sequences because I'm pretty sure the old death-run maps in Team Fortress 2 were inspired by them.

Nonetheless, there are definitely small things that could be tweaked to make the film much less morally questionable (without making the material any less resonant) - Solondz using two adult actors to play the child lead and yet seemingly insisting on putting one of the young performers in such uncomfortable situations is bewildering to me, and goes beyond the ""shock value"" he's known for into just being gross. Unfortunately there's also not much here that would make me want to return to this one, at least when compared with his earlier work.

2022-09-20,The House That Jack Built,2018,https://boxd.it/3f9MEP,3.5,,"Iâve only seen a couple of Von Trierâs films (as of now, anyway) - one I absolutely love (Dancer in the Dark), and another I find tedious and self-indulgent (Dogville). After sitting through almost three hours of misery, comedy and unflinching Self-Criticismâ¢, I find myself somewhere inbetween.

Iâll start by saying that I found the segments where Von Trier theorises about the ethics of his art interminable, saying little while filling up much of the run-time. I feel like the same comments and criticisms are made with almost every serial killer film or show (or podcast now, I guess), while never coming to any kind of satisfying conclusion as to whether their portrayal of graphic violence is warranted or not. Certainly those works do not have the sardonic sense of humour and self-hatred that Von Trier operates with, but the result is much the same, and I donât need Matt Dillon and his big glasses to inform me of it. 

Aside from that, I found a lot to like about this film. Matt Dillon is terrific, and proves once again that he shouldâve been making films like this throughout the 2000s instead of two-week running romantic comedies. He doesnât necessarily ground the narrative (as if anyone could), but he never hams up the more extreme aspects of the film, and sells the slyness of the script perfectly. Von Trier has always had good luck with internationally-renowned performers, and this may be the best of the lot, BjÃ¶rkwithstanding. The film is something of a technical marvel as well - it seems to draw from Larsâ entire career and beyond, mixing up-close cheap video cameras, grainy film, slideshows and more into a stylistic blur of a movie, elevating even the most criminal instances of navel-gazing (of which there are many), and keeping me engaged. It proves that, if nothing else, Von Trier is still an experimental and vital artist in a world with very few, even if his talent is often spent on screenplays that are far too insular to effectively convey the very broad points they attempt to make.

If you are a Trier-head, youâve probably seen and opined on this film endlessly anyway, so take this with a grain of salt. I certainly found it more engaging and interesting than Dogville, but was left with a similar feeling of emptiness and desire for a little more than I got from three hours of my time.

2022-11-02,Black Mirror: The National Anthem,2011,https://boxd.it/3oc86v,3,Yes,"still don't find it all that formally interesting really (which i only mention because i've always seen brooker as an absolutely brilliant deconstructive writer), but it's got some excellent performances and a really palpable sense of dread, even if the script is a little bit spare otherwise. it's probably because it's largely the same actors and centred around british politics, but it feels more like an iannucci thing than charlie brooker to me - i'm expecting the later black mirror episodes to have more of his sense of humour and style.",,2022-11-02

2022-11-13,Stewart Lee: Snowflake,2022,https://boxd.it/3qoFYH,4,,"it's true that Lee recycles some of the material here (the political- correctness-gone-mad-gran joke and the Ricky Gervais bit are both reworkings of older jokes from other filmed shows) but for one thing he's been doing that since the start (i've heard the ""shitted pants"" and erectile dysfunction bits like three times across specials and shows), and the added material, as well as the change in the cultural climate since those jokes were written, make for some of the funniest bits in the special. it's definitely a little wonky pace-wise, finding a groove somewhere between Comedy Vehicle and the long-form sets, but some of the material here is his best since carpet remnant world, and it's good to see Crumpled Morrissey back doing what he's best at",,2022-11-13
2022-11-16,Battles Without Honor and Humanity,1973,https://boxd.it/3r4W17,3,,"i feel the same way about this as i do about takeshi kitano's Outrage movies - it's so frenetic and quick in terms of how it deals with its characters (of whom there are a lot) that it becomes a bit weightless and disengaging. fukasaku is still a brilliant director, but i'm a little bummed out by how little i connected to much of this.",,2022-11-16
