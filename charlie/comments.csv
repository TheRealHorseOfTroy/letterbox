2018-04-12,https://boxd.it/1E4z0,"gremlins 2 has a lot of interesting stuff going for it.
jurassic world is like watching paint dry.

2018-04-14,https://boxd.it/1BXXK,"Why not make a separate list for Muppet films?

2018-05-02,https://boxd.it/1HL38,solo and jurassic world 2 look so bad holy shit
2018-05-02,https://boxd.it/1HL38,"i'm more excited for the new ant-man film, and that's REALLY saying something"
2018-05-03,https://boxd.it/1HL38,also why did you give a harry styles concert video a 10
2018-05-03,https://boxd.it/1HL38,"you can just unselect watched. it's not too difficult.

also, idk, a 6 i guess? it's not that good but it's serviceable "
2018-05-05,https://boxd.it/rHTwv,">giving plan 9 a 3/10

literally blasphemy"
2018-05-07,https://boxd.it/r5s0r,"i can confirm that this is true
"
2018-05-08,https://boxd.it/rOSFv,"i agree tbh

as a big fan of character-driven narratives i found this film incredibly dull"
2018-05-08,https://boxd.it/rOSFv,fun in the theater but i can't imagine the home-viewing experience to be very enjoyable
2018-05-13,https://boxd.it/rHTwv,"dracula's orgy is uh
definitely not the one you wanna watch"
2018-05-13,https://boxd.it/rHTwv,it's one of his weird sex-pervert films from the 70's if i remember rightly
2018-05-13,https://boxd.it/rHTwv,watch glen or glenda or bride of the monster instead
2018-05-14,https://boxd.it/rHTwv,"i mean, while none of his movies were objectively ""good"", i don't think woods films were much better or worse than any of the other drive-in horror films of his time. to answer your question, both of them are basically in the same in terms of quality but i think plan 9 has more charm"
2018-05-17,https://boxd.it/1KY0W,"Psycho is an absolute masterpiece, glad to see you watched it.

Do Vertigo next."
2018-05-17,https://boxd.it/rQ4XX,"I mean, surely if the home-viewing experience isn't anywhere near as powerful as it is in a cinema, that should be a pretty major detriment?"
2018-05-17,https://boxd.it/rQ4XX,Fair enough I guess.
2018-06-03,https://boxd.it/sFbnT,"Wow, am I the only one out of all of us who actually thought it was the best of the new films?"
2018-06-09,https://boxd.it/sNvqz,holy SHIT YOU WATCHED THE FUCKING TOXIC AVENGER

2018-06-30,https://boxd.it/tAtlF,"It's really not that great. I mean it's a lot of fun, and incredibly inspirational, but it doesn't do anything for me emotionally."
2018-06-30,https://boxd.it/tAtlF,(just watch synecdoche new york instead)
2018-07-01,https://boxd.it/tAtlF,it's so much better
2018-07-01,https://boxd.it/tAtlF,also i used to have pulp fiction as a 5 so that's probably where you got that from
2018-07-01,https://boxd.it/sWF6x,I absolutely despised this movie. I'm kind of in shock at how bad it was 
2018-07-01,https://boxd.it/sWF6x,"Nothing made any sense, and the ending was frankly embarrassing imo"
2018-07-01,https://boxd.it/sWF6x,"I meant the real ending. I mean, it was kinda funny, bit it was so fucking stupid"
2018-07-01,https://boxd.it/sWF6x,I'll cook one up tomorrow
2018-07-02,https://boxd.it/tFhvN,"watch some charlie kaufman reece

>oh.jpg"
2018-07-15,https://boxd.it/u7JzT,it's not tbh
2018-07-22,https://boxd.it/uojXJ,"You do realise that this is pretty much the best era of music we've ever had, right? Think about how easy it is now to find the music that you like and how easy it is to block out the music you don't. I feel that it's rather ignorant to say that all ""modern music"" is shit because you don't like top 40 music, which, in this day and age, is incredibly easy to avoid."
2018-07-24,https://boxd.it/uojXJ,"Swans, Radiohead, Death Grips, The Body, Kendrick Lamar (although I haven't been a fan of his last two offerings, his other output is incredible), Richard Dawson, and a plethora of other, more obscure artists over on places like SoundCloud and Bandcamp. There's some truly incredible music out there, you've just got to know where to look."
2018-08-24,https://boxd.it/vCgfB,"I mean, it technically is a comedy. It's incredibly satirical.

(it's also one of the best movies ever made, reece)"
2018-08-26,https://boxd.it/vMJB7,"that's all well and good, but let's talk about you giving anomalisa a 6"
2018-08-28,https://boxd.it/vOmXt,it's so fucking great
2018-08-28,https://boxd.it/vMJB7,smh.
2018-08-28,https://boxd.it/vMJB7,the puppet love scene makes it an easy 10
2018-09-13,https://boxd.it/wlxkD,gremlins 2 is the true kino though
2018-09-14,https://boxd.it/wlxkD,piracy exists.
2018-09-16,https://boxd.it/wvWy1,"yeah, it's kinda ignorant to throw away an entire genre because of one film you didn't like"
2018-09-25,https://boxd.it/wP1Ap,aliens sucks.
2018-09-27,https://boxd.it/wP1Ap,"That comment was mostly hyperbole, but I still view it as hollow action schlock with cookie cutter characters that really bring the film down"
2018-10-18,https://boxd.it/xz2Mt,"Who really cares what others make of your opinions? The kind of people that are going to say ""omg lol u suck becuz u just don't understand it..."" aren't worth talking to."
2018-10-20,https://boxd.it/xL2ut,somehow.
2018-10-20,https://boxd.it/vYjWH,"while yeah, i get your point entirely and rating these is kinda dumb, i only do it so i can keep track of the ones that i like and the ones that i dislike, and there's plenty of things that go into judging that."
2018-10-20,https://boxd.it/vYjWH,"also yeah this is probably like a strong 5 - light 6
:)"
2018-11-19,https://boxd.it/yc18b,I fucking love this account more than life itself
2018-12-01,https://boxd.it/zr6lN,might be wise to put the spoiler tag on this lmfao
2018-12-01,https://boxd.it/zr6lN,"Age is sort of irrelevant, there's still plenty of people who haven't seen it."

2019-01-03,https://boxd.it/ARJif,I TOLD YOU SO MANY FUCKING TIMES THAT IT'S IRONIC HOLY SHIT REECE
2019-12-23,https://boxd.it/UpMWL,"Sidelining Rose was one of the worst parts of the movie though. Pandering to fans because they didn't like her and giving her no development whatsoever was a terrible idea, much like most of the other ideas floated (and then backpedaled) throughout the film. Indecisiveness is what kills the film for me. "
2020-01-09,https://boxd.it/W5qXl,Cancelled.
2020-02-08,https://boxd.it/4JUha,Voted
2020-08-02,https://boxd.it/wP1Ap,coming back here to say that aliens does not suck and is a fantastic film and i was a total moron 
2021-12-29,https://boxd.it/2p9Sf9,"this one probably doesn't fall under irresponsible, but certainly immature and undisciplined (at least as far as my relationship with his work is concerned). i think there are a lot of very valuable ideas and sequences in the film, but after spending three hours in that world i personally didn't feel that it had earned its more confrontational moments, and meandered way too much for me to feel affected by it beyond coming away a little unsatisfied. it's definitely admirable and i get why people love it but it just didn't land for me quite like i wanted it to"
2022-02-22,https://boxd.it/2Bjz4T,yeah it's ridiculous tbh
2022-03-18,https://boxd.it/2FGjiR,5 bags and a VHS copy of To Kill a Mockingbird (129min)
2022-03-20,https://boxd.it/2GfiQX,"still not convinced rifkin's festival is a real film, even though he's made it like 10 times in the last 7 years"

2022-04-18,https://boxd.it/2LvNCJ,@gatanga is voting liberal in Aus2022. Sad!
2022-04-23,https://boxd.it/2McBbx,it's a shame he never solved the fated PS3/XBOX debate at the same time 
2022-04-24,https://boxd.it/2MzCiZ,why does data look so fucked up on the poster
2022-05-10,https://boxd.it/2Pp8ZB,this movie shows what it must be like for people who hate michael moore to watch his films
2022-05-12,https://boxd.it/2PBcah,"she also played charlie kaufman's muse in adaptation, poor lady "
2022-06-01,https://boxd.it/2T9NtP,the bit at the end where it pans out to the celebrities was funnier than anything in the special 
2022-06-30,https://boxd.it/2Yu7Gp,this is true but did you see woody's instagram interview with alec baldwin where his wifi kept cutting out 
2022-07-05,https://boxd.it/2zo6Ov,"I knocked it down a half, but I still feel every word of this in my heart"
2022-07-06,https://boxd.it/2ZIBtd,the worst thing about that daniel johnsotn covers album is it gave the industry an entire catalogue of worse versions to use and stress out 1% of their audience 
2022-10-01,https://boxd.it/3h3SXp,the fact that it spends so much time as a historical drama makes the moments where it really leans into the Spooks all the more effective
2022-10-09,https://boxd.it/f7PJG,can't even say Winterval anymore...... thanks woke moralists!
2022-10-11,https://boxd.it/iDwfy,"on the subject, there were some movies i left out out of embarrassment, including Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 and the Family Guy Star Wars trilogy, but they are all films that he has genuinely professed love for. we watched Thief and The Long Goodbye together and he said they were ""alright"", for reference"
