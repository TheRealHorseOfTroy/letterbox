2021-12-31,HK JANUARY 2022,,https://boxd.it/eDVg6,"bringing in the new year with lots of zoomy cameras and Chow Yun-Fat looking serious (aka the best way). gonna review all of these, so look in notes to see me trash your Favourite Film!!!!"

Position,Name,Year,URL,Description
1,The Killer,1989,https://boxd.it/1Vha,"inbetween my first and second watch of this film john woo became one of my absolute favourite filmmakers, something i guess you can see from the rating bump. a total masterpiece, with one of the best and most engaging narratives of woo's career. there's a grittiness captured here that's missing in many of his later films (yes, even hard boiled), and that rawness makes it kind of fascinating. hard boiled's still my fav, but this isn't too far off."
2,City on Fire,1987,https://boxd.it/XGY,"quentin tarantino owes his world to the second most famous Ringo. forgot just how visceral and grimy this movie is; Lam shoots HK like nobody else. in some ways the flipside of Chow Yun Fat's action persona - jaded, desperate and out of his league. kudos to Danny Lee as well, he's even better in this than he is in The Killer a couple years later. one of Hong Kong's finest displays of an actor/director relationship."
3,Full Contact,1992,https://boxd.it/1sAC,"there was a shot in this where Chow looked exactly like Tim Heidecker in Tom Goes to the Mayor and it distracted me throughout the final act. it was also probably the only thing i truly connected with while watching it, frankly.

kinda shocked this came out the same year as Hard Boiled in that it feels rather primitive by comparison, regardless of directorial style (and i mean, even if you were accounting for that, City on Fire feels much more confident and realised). was fun seeing several Hard Boiled actors pop up again, but i was left somewhat cold by the film as a whole."
4,Twin Dragons,1992,https://boxd.it/1GmE,"what a weird movie. obviously Ringo Lam and Tsui Hark are legendary filmmakers, and seeing so many amazing and iconic Hong Kong actors on screen together was a lot of fun, but frankly the premise wore thin at about the one-hour mark - particularly after the first big action setipece, in which the film dedicates about 15 minutes to the same gag. still had fun, but could definitely afford to shave about 20 minutes of its runtime."
5,Police Story 3: Super Cop,1992,https://boxd.it/1Uyk,"stanley tong was the filmmaker responsible for getting me into hong kong cinema/jackie chan's work in general, so obviously I was incredibly excited going into this. after seeing it, i'm left a little underwhelmed, honestly. i think the main issue is that the film's scope is simply too broad, and both jackie chan and michelle yeoh - incredible performers in their owns right - end up drowning in a plot that doesn't really service them or use their talents effectively (beyond obvious points - the last 15 mins especially!!!!). there's a lot to enjoy, and its stunts are obviously astounding, with yeoh and chan really pushing themselves to the absolute limit, but i think the series is far better when balancing the small dramas at the centre of ka-kui's life with the dizzying action and typical drug-kingpin story, as opposed to the whole ""undercover-double-agent"" thing they did here. it's good, but goes too big and kind of smothers itself."
6,Prison on Fire,1987,https://boxd.it/w2C,"the synergy between Ringo Lam and Chow Yun-Fat is really quite incredible, and carries a lot of this movie. Lam made him flesh-and-blood in a way that even the likes of John Woo, as much as i adore him, never quite could - the final sequence in this film is astounding, and almost recontextualises the way we as an audience see him as an actor (something that would happen once again with Ang Lee in the 2000s). it occasionally drags, but Prison on Fire is definitely worth seeing for its lead performances alone, and sees Lam at his grittiest and most animalistic as a writer/director."
7,Election,2005,https://boxd.it/2lDm,"a skewed notion of ""democracy"" utterly destroyed by puerility and rage. Johnnie To's Sonatine?"
8,A Better Tomorrow,1986,https://boxd.it/1TLW,"90 minutes of John Woo's greatest hits. interesting to see a lot more fight scenes in this than there are in his later work; you can really see his artistic style develop over the course of the film. one of Chow Yun-Fat's greatest performances - what an incredible breakout role. Woo literally cannot miss.

also Leslie Cheung.............................................. Zamn"
9,A Better Tomorrow II,1987,https://boxd.it/1HbW,"the last sequence in this is fucking insane, and easily one of the best things Woo has ever done. like, holy fuck.

i mean it's a mess, but i live for this shit. plenty of great melodrama, Chow Yun-Fat chewing toothpicks and pure insanity for its entire duration. i kinda love it."
10,A Better Tomorrow III: Love and Death in Saigon,1989,https://boxd.it/ZQm,"Tsui Hark is kind of an underrated action director, tbh. anyways, probably my least favourite of the trilogy but still has some great stuff. demystifying Chow's Mark character by placing him in wartime Vietnam - thus witnessing cruelty totally out of his control, unlike the infighting of the first film - was a very nice touch, and the emphasis on character drama over action sequences (admittedly, how could you top the last sequence in 2?? fair enough Tsui) makes the film stand out from its predecessors, but i found the third act to be a bit of a slog and somewhat missed the poetic justice of Woo's setpieces. still, it's a very good, somewhat standalone film, and i think i'll enjoy it more coming back to it.

no Leslie Cheung, so it sucks. terrible film. 0/10."
11,As Tears Go By,1988,https://boxd.it/1ybI,"pretty much agree with the consensus - Wong's direction is already fully-formed and beautiful, but in a kind of half-grown, primitive way. it's a very different portrait of Hong Kong (and Kowloon, which was nice to see on film after being there a while ago!) than his other work; the city functioning as less of a ""character"" than it would in much of Wong's subsequent output, which is interesting but ultimately leads the film down some fairly uninteresting roads in terms of cinematography and narrative. beyond some great performances, there's not a whole lot more to this, but it's definitely essential for fans of Wong Kar Wai, and you can probably get something out of it coming in new.

<i>(considering it was directly inspired by Scorsese's Mean Streets, it's interesting how i pretty much view both films in exactly the same way - important works that pale in comparison to what both filmmakers would go on to do.)</i>"
12,Ashes of Time,1994,https://boxd.it/111K,"utterly beautiful, and some really tender moments here and there, but overall it's a bit of a mess. was mostly only engaged by Doyle's cinematography and a couple performances (particularly Maggie Cheung's heartbreaking final sequence), but my favourite film exists because of this, so i'll chuck on an extra half-star. thanks Wong!!!"
13,Exiled,2006,https://boxd.it/1Pn2,"fucking incredible performances and amazing setpieces elevate this fairly standard triad film. Johnnie To was perhaps the greatest HK filmmaker of the 2000s, really elevating Chinese gangster cinema to a true art form. i need to see Throw Down again..."
14,Tiger on the Beat,1988,https://boxd.it/366,"tries to have its cake and eat it too in terms of balancing gunplay and martial arts sequences a-la Police Story, and (mostly) succeeds. some pretty questionable gender politics and a generally drab second act drag it down, but its two magnetic leads and one of the greatest HK filmmakers behind the camera really save it from monotony. good stuff."
15,The Hand,2020,https://boxd.it/vWp0,"effortlessly beautiful. i find it difficult writing at length about Wong Kar-Wai's 2000s output before i start to froth at the mouth and descend into incoherence, but i'm extremely glad that this has been released and remastered individually, because it absolutely deserves it. Chang Chen and Gong Li............................ oh baby........................."
16,The Mission,1999,https://boxd.it/OvW,"the more i see of Johnnie To, the more i admire his work. his ability to wean likeable, memorable characters and genuine suspense out of fairly standard triad stand-ins/plot-lines really is astounding. he's a really underrated action director too - his action scenes don't really look like anyone else's in HK cinema."
17,Election 2,2006,https://boxd.it/1MRe,"better-looking but not as engaging as the first. mostly plays out like a re-assertion of the ideas of not only the original but most of To's filmmography; as a result it's absolutely stunning to look at, but nowhere near as emotionally charged or angry as To's other variations on this theme."
18,Days of Being Wild,1990,https://boxd.it/1HbC,"""being unhappy together"" seems like a pretty good summation of Wong's entire filmmography.

i miss leslie cheung."
19,Dragon Inn,1967,https://boxd.it/3xGa,"everything about this is basically perfect. King Hu's use of the frame, the scenery, the performers - it's all expertly handled, and makes for a pretty astonishing viewing experience. i feel like i will have a lot more to say when i see this wonderful film again, but for now i'll just say yeah, it Rocks."
20,The Legend of Drunken Master,1994,https://boxd.it/1Si0,"Jackie Chan gets drunk and destroys colonialism.

for me, this film is so great because Jackie perfectly finds the balance between the humour and kind of divine weight of martial arts, and walks that line beautifully. he knows that to get an audience to root for him he has to craft a character that's human and fallible but still, you know, deliver the goods when the time comes - as a result, there's not only tension during those fight scenes, but a level of likability that stems from those earlier set-ups that allows Chan freedom to deliver these amazing, complex moves without ever losing the charming affability of the character he's playing. you feel a kinship with Chan that you just don't get from the likes of Bruce Lee/Jet Li/Donnie Yen/whoever else, and it draws you in instantly. i still prefer Police Story, but this has a special place in my heart as one of the earliest introductions to HK cinema i had, back when i still rented DVDs and watched videos on the Cinemassacre website - the footwork in the final fight scene still blows my mind."
21,Three,2016,https://boxd.it/cYWW,"there's definitely some good stuff here, and the message To is trying to get across is certainly an admirable one, but i just absolutely hated how this was shot. shit looked like an airline ad half the time, which took me out of the film enough to be bored during the (admittedly well-done) climax and left feeling totally cold and distant. it's good, just not for me."
22,In the Mood for Love,2000,https://boxd.it/29tE,"for me, the secret of the film reveals itself in those final scenes - beyond the haunting beauty of the romance shared by Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung (moreso as an idea than something tangible) lies a city in limbo; uncertain times becoming ever more uncertain, social and political ambiguity lurking behind well-meaning, well-mannered inhabitants. i think the fact that this is, in many ways, a traditional British romance (a-la Brief Encounter) is an interesting one- setting the story in such a visceral, colourful and somewhat idealistic 60s Hong Kong, Wong Kar-Wai takes an already great film and adds an utterly singular flare to it, very subtly challenging the relationship between Britain and Hong Kong, simultaneously during the time in which the film is set, the time it was released, and continuing to grow in relevance as the years goes by.

in some ways, it's the ultimate Hong Kong film, and one of the finest i have ever seen. i think i finally have to move it into my top 10 of all time."
23,The Grandmaster,2013,https://boxd.it/QU0,"suffers from the same problems as Ashes of Time insofar as it contains utterly stunning imagery but seemingly not very much underneath. i kinda need to see this one again irrespective of finishing this list for a more concrete opinion, but its creative and breathtaking cinematography certainly work in its favour."
24,The Big Boss,1971,https://boxd.it/1RU8,not really all that engaging beyond the astonishing physicality of bruce lee. more interesting as a piece of hong kong film history than a standalone film.
25,Armour of God,1986,https://boxd.it/1UXa,"some really great setpieces but (similarly to twin dragons) also a lot of fluff that really drag it down. still, jackie nearly died in this, and as usual there's some fantastic stuntwork, but it's somewhat lacking in the stunning choreography and charming goofiness of chan's other films from around this time."
26,The Heroic Trio,1993,https://boxd.it/TYu,"big fan of these ladies and their various attacks on shapeshifting anthony wong.

(it's to/cheung/yeoh. not much more to say.)"
27,Love Massacre,1981,https://boxd.it/5xXk,"need to see this one again. beautiful to look at but i kind of got lost thanks to the questionable subtitles on my personal copy (and everyone else's it seems) which, alongside a lot of its abstract imagery, left me somewhat disconnected for long stretches of time. still, there are absolutely stunning sequences here that really make me yearn for a remaster of some kind (without destroying its unique look, of course)."
28,One-Tenth of a Millimeter Apart,2021,https://boxd.it/uDdM,"didn't have subs, didn't care. 30 minutes of pure visual bliss."
29,Heroes Shed No Tears,1984,https://boxd.it/2byc,"the blueprint for everything woo would go on to do, and really interesting as a result. i don't think the tonal shift from somewhat realistic war drama to the usual Heroic Bloodshed stuff works quite as well here as it would in later films (both from woo and other filmmakers active during the 80s action wave) but it's still got a great sense of style and remains necessary viewing for any fans of john woo's early period."
30,Happy Together,1997,https://boxd.it/1Ha0,"perhaps it's the ultimate wong kar-wai film in terms of its utterly staggering portrait of utter loneliness, relationships in disrepair, and the light shining through all of it. my brain is mush and my heart aches.

also change the poster, the rooftop one is so much better!!!"
31,Chungking Express,1994,https://boxd.it/1UDa,"there was a point during this (sixth) watch of this film (in the span of less than a year) where i thought i may not love it as much as i did the fifth time, then california dreamin kicked in and my faith in the world was restored once again. this will never not be my favourite movie."
