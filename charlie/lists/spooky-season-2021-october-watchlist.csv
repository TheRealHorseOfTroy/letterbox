Position,Name,Year,URL,Description
1,Videodrome,1983,https://boxd.it/29uC,"<i>(i agree with none of this now, so look at this this as like, archival or something)</i>

One of the most frustrating movies I think I've ever seen. A complete mess - initially a pretty broad critique of ""The Media"", the film quickly abandons that framework and devolves into a sluggish and self-centred display that ultimately doesn't seem to have the confidence to back up its own philosophy. The effects are solid, but not only does it feel undeserved, it feels almost gutless. If I were to use Cronenberg's most celebrated film as an example, The Fly is able to balance its body horror with characters we can at least feel some sympathy for; these characters feel like allegories without allegories, symbols that don't really represent anything other than tropey character-traits that don't even really get developed past the half-hour mark. Cronenberg is a talented filmmaker, and it's admirable that a film like this could even exist in the mid-80s American circuit, but it is still wildly inconsistent and seems to talk a lot while saying very, very little."
2,The Hunger,1983,https://boxd.it/1Tk2,"What a gorgeous movie. Great performances and an unrelentingly dreamy vibe - it's a genre film through-and-through, yet feels as though it exists in several different worlds. Tony Scott is seemingly able to pull the film wherever he pleases, matching up frenetically-edited gothic horror with a vivid sense of sensuality and use of the frame, a-la Blue Velvet, or the 70s-era Hitchcock that influenced both. It's not a perfect film but I have nothing but admiration for its dedication to such a unique aesthetic, and it is able to create a more vivid sense of fear than any of the gross-out body horror/slasher films from the time. Maybe a good double-feature with Roeg's Don't Look Now?

10/10 would bang 129 year-old david bowie"
3,Don't Look Now,1973,https://boxd.it/29fC,"One of the best ""horror"" films of its era, or any era. Such a powerful and unique meditation on loss, grief, spirituality and premonition, set in front of a gorgeous Venetian backdrop. Pleasance and Christie deliver career-defining performances, and Roeg proves himself to be a master unrestrained by genre. One of the best British films ever made."
4,Repo Man,1984,https://boxd.it/1Plg,"Hadn't seen this one in years, and was pleased to find it really holds up. While I do think it drags a little bit in the last third, there's still so much to love - Alex Cox's clear passion for filmmaking was evident right from the beginning, shooting Los Angeles so vividly and beautifully, and seeing Harry Dean Stanton in a top-billing role is always good. There's not much to be said about this film that hasn't been said already, but it's obviously a shame that Alex Cox's career as a filmmaker didn't continue past Walker (a film I will someday write at length about), and I do kind of wish he had the opportunity to make a major studio genre film like this again."
5,The Brood,1979,https://boxd.it/1ovS,"So glad to finally be able to say I love a Cronenberg movie. Just a fascinating look into his mind, on top of being genuinely scary and perfectly paced. I wish all Divorced Directors™ made films this good."
6,The Evil Dead,1981,https://boxd.it/29Go,"A long-standing favourite of mine, but after several viewings over the years it does kinda get a bit harder to sit through, mainly because almost everything in this film was improved upon in its sequel. Still, a fun one to come back to once in a while, and totally changed my perspective on film when I first saw it."
7,Evil Dead II,1987,https://boxd.it/29Ge,"I mean, I wouldn't even be watching movies if it weren't for this. Sparked my passion for horror cinema, crazy and inventive visual techniques, and Bruce Campbell. It's perfect."
8,Army of Darkness,1992,https://boxd.it/29G4,"Rewatching this and the original Evil Dead film more or less annually is always fun, but I'm left with the same issues every time. Obviously the movie's fun as hell, and Bruce Campbell finally cements the image of both himself and the Ash character here (paving the way for the wonderful Ash vs Evil Dead), but I find the second half of Army of Darkness very hard to sit through - the final battle sequence just doesn't quite capture the scope of the films it's poking fun at, making a lot of it fall a little flat. It's great to see so many in-camera/practical effects on display, and probably has the most creative camerawork of the entire trilogy, but doesn't really stick the landing, at least for me. Not amazing, and kind of grows off me the more times I revisit it, but there's still a lot to love."
9,Jennifer's Body,2009,https://boxd.it/1Efw,"It's a shame the campiness of this movie wasn't played up so much more in its marketing; I feel like it would've been re-appraised so much quicker if that were the case. Anyway, it's pretty great; existing in that sweet-spot of being dated, but in a charming, remember-when-whiny-emo-pop-was-popular-and-people-texted-in-abbreviations kinda way. It's really well-directed too - considering all the awful direct-to-dumpster horror movies that were floating around in '09 it's refreshing to see a filmmaker actually play with the frame and craft a unique atmosphere -and the script is sharp, funny and though it occasionally falters in blurring the lines between horror and comedy it mostly sticks the landing. 

Also, Megan Fox should've been some kind of B-Movie/horror staple instead of the Ninja Turtle lady - she's pretty great in this."
10,Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter,1984,https://boxd.it/1XWO,"This should've been a slapstick comedy involving Jason and Corey Feldman's Home Alone-esque props and traps. Missed opportunity.

Adding characters to the mix who are separated from the campers is a very good choice, and gives the audience someone to actually root for beyond the usual preppy high-schoolers we get in most of the F13 films. Tom Savini is great as usual, but it does still suffer from the same flaws as the others in the series - lots of annoying characters just sort of wondering about, a rather confused tone at times, and just generally uninteresting direction drag it down, but this is probably my favourite of the first four films.

Also, how many fucking reels were in that projector? Béla Tarr would never..."
11,Manhunter,1986,https://boxd.it/1TOw,"Absolutely beautiful to look at. Great script and some career-defining performances from Noonan and Cox, and though it's not Tangerine Dream, still has a great synth-led score. Mann has such great attention to detail in how he frames his shots here - Lecktor's plain-white cell, the blue-neon hues leaking through the windows of the Graham household, the ominous Blake painting in the middle of the killer's house - all give off such a tremendous atmosphere, and elevate the film a great deal. Surely one of the best-looking thrillers of its time, and gives the film a sense of heightened-reality that I haven't seen replicated (at least as successfully) in a lot of other crime films."
12,Scanners,1981,https://boxd.it/1YqE,"The premise is obviously fantastic, but another great thing it does is allow the film to be pretty low-key, saving the biggest moments for very specific points, making those payoffs absolutely fantastic. I suppose the fact that it's as restrained as it is has led a lot of people to finding it dull, which I suppose is fair, but I see it as an impressively mature move on the part of Cronenberg (at least this early in his career), and it elevates the film massively. Not quite my favourite of his yet, but it's great."
13,Near Dark,1987,https://boxd.it/1SRO,"Really great climax, but kind of ebbed and flowed too much beforehand for me to really care all that much. Well-directed and yet another great Tangerine Dream score, but I dunno, I didn't really connect with it beyond surface-level appreciation."
14,In the Mouth of Madness,1994,https://boxd.it/26vi,"I enjoy this film more and more every time I see it. Cosmic horror has never really been my thing (I find Lovecraft incredible boring, sorry NERDS...) but when it's done well it can be startlingly effective, as is the case here. Sam Neill plays it perfectly straight (for the most part), and Carpenter really lays his personal style bare, playing with a wide frame reminiscent of some of Hitchcock's later work. Maybe one of his most surreal films, and definitely one of his most effective."
15,eXistenZ,1999,https://boxd.it/27Ni,"So fucking silly and great. Cronenberg is just having a good time here, and it's finally pushed me over the edge into being a fan of his. Some of his best visuals, too, and a more interesting commentary on media development and filmmaking than his more celebrated Videodrome. This movie owns."
16,The Exorcist,1973,https://boxd.it/1Yoo,"A perfect family drama, a perfect character-study, a perfect horror film. Friedkin and Blatty's own differing perspectives on the material give the film a perfectly frenetic feel, and add an extra layer of tension to the spiritual and existential dread facing the MacNeil family, and it sits perfectly in that early-to-mid 70s new wave of American filmmakers, crafting bold and boundary-pushing work that still has the same effect on the viewer nearly 50 years later."
17,Invasion of the Body Snatchers,1978,https://boxd.it/1SWk,"Great-looking film, but ultimately I'm left cold by it. Kind of disappointed I don't have more to say, but it's still worth your time."
18,The Thing,1982,https://boxd.it/294O,"Just remembered the time me and my brother watched this movie while babysitting a 2 year old. Whoops!

It's The Thing. It's good. Not my favourite Carpenter, but still top-tier. Good effects. Cute dogs. Kurt Russell.

If you have an account on this site you should probably have seen this film several times already, so a long review will not tell you anything you don't already know. I also re-organised my shelves while watching this, so I can't be fucked writing anything substantive. The written review format has never been more effectively used!"
19,Shaun of the Dead,2004,https://boxd.it/29J8,It's kind of amazing that I still find new things in this film after seeing it like 10 times in the last four or five years. Maybe the best British film of the last 20 years?
20,Tetsuo: The Iron Man,1989,https://boxd.it/ZoM,"One of the most creative, disgusting, imaginative horror films of the 80s. Theoretically it seems like the kind of thing that can't effectively exist outside of, say, animation or manga, yet Tsukamoto pulls it off, using everything in his arsenal. It's pretty much perfect."
21,The Dead Zone,1983,https://boxd.it/1U6g,"One of Christopher Walken's greatest performances. Takes its premise completely seriously, and is all the better for it. Not about spectacle, all about atmosphere. Spending two hours in the presence of Walken's tormented-but-hopeful Johnny Smith, you really get the feeling that Cronenberg found a perfect sense of balance with this film. It's quite brilliant, and surprising that a film as restrained as this could come out the same year as perhaps his most insane and unhinged movie. I dig it."
22,Ringu,1998,https://boxd.it/26tw,"So uncompromisingly atmospheric. The rural Japanese backdrop really gives a lot to the procedural elements of the script, so much so that I really can't see Verbinski's version (which I haven't seen as of late) comparing in any way. It's a perfectly-paced slow burner that really gets under your skin, with some really great performances too."
23,The Ring,2002,https://boxd.it/2a70,"Good first half, but its elaborations are unnecessary and it doesn't add much to the original beyond Verbinski's neat colour palette and Naomi Watts. Yeah."
24,Sole Survivor,1984,https://boxd.it/1n5Y,"Very fun and atmospheric low-budget horror film. I didn't find anything super riveting about it, but I had a lot of fun. There's a lot of stunning visuals that could only have come from a restrained budget and a creative team, and it has some good central performances. Not a cult favourite or anything, but worth seeing."
25,Dressed to Kill,1980,https://boxd.it/1UO8,"Simultaneously love and hate a lot about this film. Obviously it's highly problematic with its cliched and offensive portrayal of trans people, and I honestly found the first third with Angie Dickinson pretty uncomfortable to sit through, but at the same time the rest of the movie is an incredibly entertaining and engaging thriller that I kinda loved. I dunno, it's a hard film to recommend because it really is problematic to the point where it's almost impossible to look past that fact (plus De Palma has better movies in this style), but I can't lie and say I didn't have a good time while watching it."
26,Halloween,2018,https://boxd.it/f0uE,"what kind of normal teen watches fucking Repo Man of all things on halloween night??

I like it a little less this time around. Really solid first act, teeters in the second, falls in the third. It reminded me personally a lot of Halloween 2 (even aping off some of the same scares, particularly the first scene with Michael after escaping the bus, which is ripped straight out of that film), but without the benefit of Dean Cundey's cinematography and without the hindrance of John Carpenter's (self-admittedly) drunken and slightly shoddy script. It's the best sequel since Season of the Witch (obviously), and there's lots to like, I just wish I found it more compelling as a whole."
27,Halloween Kills,2021,https://boxd.it/mxzG,"Sure it's more of the same, kind of meandering and totally structureless, but I had a really great time watching it. Kinda don't see why everyone else finds it so terrible compared to 2018; it's got some great gore, another great Carpenter score, a fairly fun (if lacking and kind of inconsistent) cast of characters - it's the kind of thing that you don't feel you need to see more than once, but it's great fun in a theater. Idk, I really liked it."
28,The Seventh Curse,1986,https://boxd.it/12XA,"As with most movies, this needed more Chow Yun-Fat, and it's not quite as good as Riki-Oh, but still a lot of fun. It's pretty different from Lam Nga Kai's other works - it's quite restrained visually-speaking, and although this is both a bonus (the movie looks beautiful) and a bit of a hindrance (not as wildly inventive as his other work) it makes for an interesting watch. Might be a good one to see alongside a few Raimi movies with The Guys."
29,Halloween,1978,https://boxd.it/2wRu,"One of Carpenter's most visually-inventive and best-looking films, even now. It's amazing how this still has such a hold on audiences nearly 45 years later, and I think it really is down to how well-made much of it is. Less of an obvious ""sins of the parents come down on their children"" story than the films that followed it, but as such is almost made even more gripping - nobody and everybody in Haddonfield is ultimately to blame for cases like the Myers'. The banality of evil in a cheap Shatner mask."
30,Halloween II,1981,https://boxd.it/1UeE,"Aside from Dean Cundey's cinematography this is a pretty underwhelming continuation of the events of the first. Donald Pleasence phones it in so hilariously hard (I guess that's kind of a plus), and the script is literally half-baked (Carpenter wrote it drunk), and it shows. The series is infinitely more compelling without the ideas introduced in this one, at least for me. Still, you get some nice steadicam shots and some more lovely ""Illinois"" atmosphere."
31,Halloween III: Season of the Witch,1982,https://boxd.it/1VFc,"Tom Atkins has been my favourite 80s Horror Dad since I first saw him in Night of the Creeps when I was like 12, so it's always fun to revisit this. Fun as hell, campy as hell, kinda slips up a little in the middle but has a great third act. I'd write more but after watching five movies in one day I'm pretty much criticism-ed out. Watch it!"
