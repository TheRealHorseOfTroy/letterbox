1,Ikiru,1952,https://boxd.it/251c,"Kurosawa made several grand, sweeping historical epics, and yet perhaps the most profound image of his 50-year career involved one man, one swing and one softly-spoken song. One of the greatest films ever made."
2,Seven Samurai,1954,https://boxd.it/2axi,"People often do this film a disservice when discussing it. While it's certainly valid to talk about its influence, tangentially or otherwise, on pretty much every major film since the 60s and 70s, and its flawless performances and direction, there's so much here beyond that. While it's not my favourite Kurosawa, I do think it may be my favourite script of his - the English-language remakes and ""reimaginings"" of Seven Samurai often take its base story and little else, crafting cheap caricatures with obvious character traits and motivations, making the inevitable final confrontation pretty sterile and boring, totally misunderstanding what makes the film so successful. These characters are loveable, yes, but also perfectly realised; Kurosawa and his co-writers have the courage to fully develop them and their world, and make the film's second half so incredibly powerful and beautiful as a result. Like so many Japanese films of the immediate post-war period, the film is a subtle critique of Japanese culture and ancient history, shown most obviously by the clear divide between the farmers and samurai that ultimately never finds itself resolved, yet does so in a way that never overshadows the universality of its story. It's a perfectly-handled narrative, beautifully directed and performed. It is very good, a controversial take that will surely get me ""Blocked & Removed"".

more like ""tush""-iro mifune tho am i right :)))"

5,The Bad Sleep Well,1960,https://boxd.it/1iLA,"One of Kurosawa's angriest, most passionate films, and possibly his best contemporary work. Mifune is unbelievably good (as always) but Kamatari Fujiwara steals the show as the disgruntled former-employee of Public Corps., tying the film's intricate, Shakespearian narrative together and making the film endlessly exciting. I'd throw its hat in alongside Death by Hanging as the greatest anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist film in 1960s Japanese cinema."

20,The Hidden Fortress,1958,https://boxd.it/295M,"Honestly in the running for my least favourite of his films, but still something of a classic Kurosawa jidaigeki, Beautifully shot in widescreen, but frankly not as effective in use as the two films that followed. It's fun, but occasionally aimless and feels like Kurosawa very effectively treading water."
