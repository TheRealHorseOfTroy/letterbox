2022-09-25,Knife+Heart,2018,https://boxd.it/3g5H23,3,,"This was such a trip. I definitely recommend this if you're looking for something original. Some really fun moments throughout, though the third act got a bit spotty. The score was so beautiful and so were the visuals. The epilogue scene/end credits scene may be one of the most gorgeous things put to cinema <3","lgbt, erotic, gay, sexual, trippy",
2022-09-25,Vivarium,2019,https://boxd.it/3g5KH9,4,,I cannot stress this enough: Watch Vivarium! One of the most creative and off-the-wall horror/thriller films I've seen in a long time. I truly do not understand why the reception for this movie is so mediocre. Such a thrilling ride that keeps you on your toes the entire time.,"reality bending, insane, claustrophobic",
2022-09-25,She Dies Tomorrow,2020,https://boxd.it/3g5Luv,2.5,,"I'm so unsure how to feel about this film? It has a really cool concept, but I feel like it doesn't take it far enough. There are aspects to this that I really like. The freak, morbid comedy it has to it is really great at times! But the movie lingers sooo much. I recommend this to a patient watcher.",,
2022-09-25,The Nowhere Inn,2020,https://boxd.it/3g5M6T,3.5,,Strong Mulholland Dr. vibes. Watching this genuinely fucked with my brain and my concept of reality and I loved every second.,,
2022-09-25,The Lion King II: Simba's Pride,1998,https://boxd.it/3g5XbF,2,,"Incredibly weird ""daddy's little girl"" content here...",,
2022-09-25,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2022,https://boxd.it/3g5Y0N,1,,"The film that made me stop caring about the MCU. What they do to Wanda in this film is irredeemable, and that's only the half of it. This film is nonsensical, inconsistent, painfully unfunny and just ugly to look at.",,
2022-09-25,"Love, Death & Robots: Jibaro",2022,https://boxd.it/3g60Bh,2,,This episode is an headache to endure and is nowhere near as deep as it thinks it is.,,
2022-09-25,Waiting...,2005,https://boxd.it/3g62H7,1,,This movie is actually an abomination to society. Have never seen such a comedy that is so out-of-touch and abhorrent in quality. Truly the only enjoyment you get out of this is laughing at how awful and shocking the dialogue is.,,
2022-09-25,AVP: Alien vs. Predator,2004,https://boxd.it/3g63wp,1,,It's kind of amazing thinking about how much they dropped the ball on this movie. How do you make an Alien/Predator crossover film boring? Also Predator x human woman??????,,
2022-09-26,American Pie,1999,https://boxd.it/3g656j,1,,"Movies like this and Superbad baffle me... How did we let stupid, inane, totally misogynistic films like this become these huge cultural zeitgeists?? Legitimately fuck the patriarchy lmao. I am so glad that there isn't a place for this shit now.",,
2022-09-26,Circle,2015,https://boxd.it/3g65fF,1.5,,"Incredible premise, terrible execution lol",,
2022-09-26,Blockers,2018,https://boxd.it/3g66sZ,3,,This was actually kind of the best kind of teen comedy? Really well-written characters and surprisingly amazing positive enforcement for teens beginning to be sexually active!,,
2022-09-26,Belladonna of Sadness,1973,https://boxd.it/3g67QX,2.5,,"This movie is morally really fuckin weird. Hate that the main character is legitimately being sexually assaulted so much, yet the actress sounds like she's enjoying it?? Idk, it has gorgeous animation, but I can't get behind the massive following of a movie that perpetrates such a tone-deaf depiction of themes so extreme.",,
2022-09-26,Do Revenge,2022,https://boxd.it/3g69yr,0.5,,"Fuuuuuuuuck this movie so hard. This transparent piece of shit cares about nothing but getting its inevitable teen following, through its use of buzzwords and queerbaiting. This film is all budget, no thought. The two main characters literally leak half the school's nudes and treats that as a victory????????? The only good thing to come out of this movie is the (hopefully) fat paycheck and attention towards genuinely great songs by musicians who deserve better than to be represented by this Mean Girls wannabe.",,
2022-09-26,Werewolves Within,2021,https://boxd.it/3g6aTb,3,,"You can tell everyone involved had a blast making this movie. Has a very strong footing in improv comedy, a la SNL, so stay away if that's not your vibe. The last 15 mins or so kinda drag as well unfortunately... Otherwise this movie is a blast and kept me highly entertained!",,
2022-10-27,Lake Mungo,2008,https://boxd.it/3mOX5V,2.5,,Disappointing. Movie builds up very good tension only to shit on its audience with a lame plot twist halfway through the film that kind of isn't a plot twist in the end anyway? Rest of the movie just felt not worth it after that.,,2022-10-27
